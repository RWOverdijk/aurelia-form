# Element

Certain properties on the element are reserved for extra features. Let's see
what these properties have to offer.

## attributes

It is possible to set attributes on the input elements. The `attributes`
property is used for this. This allows one to use the html builtin
[input attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_input.asp)

## hidden

In certain cases one would want to hide an element. A use case where this
applies is when using the `<entity-form>`. One might not have control over the
schema that is generated by the entity-form component. One can however extend
the schema by using a decorator which extends the schema when generating it.

## attached and detached

Is called using the the form field's context. For convenience the form field
component's element is passed as a callback. An example of a schema that uses
attached would be nice.

```js

  let loginForm = [{
    key: 'username',
    attached: element => {
      element.setAttribute('readonly', true);
    }
  }, {
    key: 'password',
    type: 'password'
  }];

```

In this case we are not adding event listeners. No need for removing those so
no need for a detached.
